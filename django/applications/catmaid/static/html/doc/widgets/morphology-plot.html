<h1>Morphology Plot</h1>
<p>
  This widget is a histogram based analysis tool which provides information on
  nodes with a similar distance to a reference location, which can be a specified
  in the user interface.  Example choices are the root node or the average node
  position. Around this center, spheres are formed with an increasing radius that
  can be defined by the user and defaults to 1000nm per step. All nodes within the
  part of a sphere that doesn\'t overlap with the last smaller sphere is treated
  as one bin of a histogram. This is shown for three bins in 2D below:</p>

  Which nodes are part of which bin depends heavily on the morphology of a
  neuron. The widget allows then to compute various metrics on those bins:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Sholl analysis:</b> The number of edges intersecting with the boundary
      of the smaller sphere. Notice that if parent-child segments are longer than
      radius-increment in the radial direction, some parent-child segments will be
      counted more than once, which is correct.</li>
    <li><b>Radial density of cable:</b> Approximate aggregated cable length per
      bin by adding the length of all child-parent edges of all child nodes in the
      bin.</li>
    <li><b>Radial density of branch nodes:</b>The number of branch nodes in a
      particular bin.</li>
    <li><b>Radial density of ends:</b> The number of end nodes in a particular
      bin.</li>
    <li><b>Radial density of input synapses:</b> The number of input synapses in
      a particular bin.</li>
    <li><b>Radial density of output synapses:</b> The number of output synapses
      in a particular bin.</li>
    <li><b>Radial density of gap junctions:</b> The number of gap junctions in a
      particular bin.</li>
    <li><b>Radial density of desmosomes:</b> The number of desmosomes in a
      particular bin.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  The plot itself shows the distance from the selected center on the X axis and
  the bin value (e.g. the number of end nodes) is shown on the Y axis.
