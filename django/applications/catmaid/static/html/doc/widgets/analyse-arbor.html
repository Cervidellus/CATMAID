<p>
The <em>Analyze Arbor</em> widget shows different statics on whole neurons and
different parts of them. Its working set of skeletons is shown in the table at
the top, which skeletons can be added or removed through the source selector and
buttons like <em>Append</em> in the widget toolbar, like it is the case with
many widgets.
</p>

<p>
This table is divided into information on four different views on a neuron,
which are determined by CATMAID automatically by assuming the root node of a
skeleton is at its soma and the end of visible microtubules are marked using the
<em>microtubules end</em> tag. The neuron's axonic and dendritic parts are
determined using flow centrality (FC):
<ol>
  <li><em>Arbor:</em> this is the entire skeleton</li>
  <li><em>Backbone:</em> all nodes reachable from the root node until a
    "microtubules end" tag is found</li>
  <li><em>Dendrites:</em> the dendritic nodes according to FC, usually most of
    inputs</li>
  <li><em>Axon terminals:</em> the axon as determined by FC, usually most
    outputs</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
For each of those a set of statistics is listed:
<ol>
  <li><em>Cable (nm):</em>: the total length of the respective part, gaussian
    smoothed with a sigma of 200 nm</li>
  <li><em>Inputs:</em> the number of postsynaptic sites</li>
  <li><em>Outputs:</em> the number of presynaptic sites</li>
  <li><em>Time (min):</em> the number of minutes in which nodes have been
    created in this part</li>
  <li><em>Mitochondria:</em> The number of nodes tagged with "mitochondrium" in
    this part</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The second part of the widget visualizes various histograms and statistics
for each part.
