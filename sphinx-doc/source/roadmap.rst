Roadmap
=======

The direction of future CATMAID development depends on research goals and wishes
expressed by its users. To get a better big picture view, some of these ideas
are listed below. This roadmap document is a loose collection of features,
changes and bug fixes that we hope can be tackled in a future release. This list
is not exhaustive and a more detailed list can be found in our `issue tracker
<https://github.com/catmaid/CATMAID/issues>`_. It tries to be more accessible
and somewhat representative of the general direction of development:

- Consistent support for data from servers other than the regular back-end, e.g.
  being able to load remote skeletons into all widgets.
- Mobile version: for browsing and analysis, not for reconstruction or proofreading.
- Simulation widget
- Catalysis widget for comparing and grouping neurons left-right and by lineage
- Expand the list of tools for cross-linking data sets.
- Ensure scalability to mouse brain dimensions and number of neurons
