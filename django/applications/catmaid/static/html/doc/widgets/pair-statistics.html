  <h3>Neuron pair statistics</h3>

  <p>This widget assists with assigning lineages and cell type annotations to sets
  of neurons and verifying assigned annotations are consistent with the observed
  morpholgy. In order to do this, it relies heavily on a particular use of
  <em>annotations</em> and <em>meta-annotations</em> (annotations on
  annotations). From a pool of annotations, group annotations are selected based
  on whether ther name matches a particular pattern (e.g. pick only annotations
  with an underscore character and use everything in front of the first
  underscore as the group name). These groups are then further divided into
  subgroups/instances, based on a second pattern (e.g. everything after the
  first underscore character will become the subgroup name.</p>

  <p>For each annotation-based subgroup within each group all annotated neurons are
  selected.</p>

  <h4>Defining a pool of annotations</h4>

  <p>The pool of annotations to work on can be defined in terms of a general
  pattern (<em>Annotation filter</em> field in the UI), which can be a regular
  expression if it starts with a forward slash character. Alternatively, a
  meta-annotation can be specified (<em>Meta-annotation</em> field in the UI),
  which all candidate annotations need to be annotated with.</p>

  <p>It is of course fine to use all available annotations (e.g. with a regular
  expression: <span class="inline-code">/.*</span> Generelly it seems cleaner to
  constrain all available annotations to the ones that should form the actual
  pool of options.</p>

  <p>Updating the filter pattern will updatea the table below that shows the
  list of groups and subgroups based on the current configuration.</em>

  <p><em>Example:</em> Assume all relevant annotations start with an asterisk and
  have the suffix "-cencus". A useful <em>annotation filter</em> would be this
  regular expression: <span class="inline-code">/^\*.*-census$</span>.</p>

  <h4>Groups and subgroups</h4>

  <p>With a set of pool of candidate annotations defined, groups and subgroups
  can now be extracted. Groups can contain multiple annotations if their name
  shares a common pattern, e.g. the same text in front of the first underscore
  character. Subgroups are groups within groups: all annotations that consitute
  a group are further devided based on a second pattern. The allows to represent
  different variants of the group. Both patterns are expressed in a single
  regular expression, where the first match-group (pair of parentheses)
  represents the group name and the second match-group represents the subgroup.
  An example can hopefully illustrate this point a bit more:</p>

  <p><em>Example:</em> We have organized the lineage annotations following the
  pattern <span class="inline-code">&lt;lineage-name&gt;_&lt;side&gt;</span>
  where <span class="inline-code">&lt;lineage-name&gt;</span> (the part before the
  underscore) represents the lineage name (e.g. BLDc) and the part right after
  the underscore (<span class="inline-code">&lt;side&gt;</span>) denotes the
  left or the right side of the brain, specified by either <span
  class="inline-code">l</span> or <span class="inline-code">r</span>. As a
  grouping pattern we could therefore write. In such a setup, we can use the
  default <em>Grouping pattern</em>: <span class="inline-code">/(.*)_([lr])
  </span>. The part from the begining of the annotation name up to the first
  underscore is stored as the first match-group, the group name: <span
  class="inline-code">/(.*) </span>. The subgroup name is by either <span
  class="inline-code">l</span> or <span class="inline-code">r</span> right after
  the underscore by the second match-group: <span class="inline-code">([lr])
  </span>. This will then match annotations like <span class="inline-code">
  BLDc_l</span> and <span class="inline-code">BLDc_r</span> and would map them
  to separate subgroups. Note that this pattern also works if the annotation
  name continues after the side specification, like with the "-census" suffix
  from the previous example, e.g.  <span class="inline-code">
  BLDc_l-cencsus</span> and <span class="inline-code">BLDc_r-cencus</span>. If
  an annotation from the pool doesn't match this pattern, it won't contribute to
  the set of grouping annotations.</p>

  <p>In addition to the group and subgroup pattern, it is also possible to only
  allow groups that have a minimum and maximum number of subgroups through the
  <em>Min subgroups</em> and <em>Max subgroups</em> fields.</p>

  <h4>Extra groups and subgroups</h4>

  <p>Sometimes there are outliers to a common pattern or there is no pattern in
  the first place. This widget allows to also add custom groups and subgroups,
  as long as they can be mapped to actual annotations. To add a custom group,
  add first a group name in the <em>Group name</em> field in the <em>New
  group</em> section. The group's subgroups are defined in terms of a comma
  separate list consisting of the patterns <span class="inline-code">
  &lt;subgroup-name&gt;|&lt;annotation-name&gt;</span>, where <span class="inline-code">
  &lt;subgroup-name&gt;</span> defines the name of the subgroup (like <span
  class="inline-code">l</span> and <span class="inline-code">r</span> above).
  Each subgroup entry is mapped to a particular annotation, which is given by
  the <span class="inline-code">&lt;annotation-name&gt;</span> part. Pressing
  the "Add" button, will add the extra group to the list of "Extra groups" in
  the content section. It is possible to add multiple extra groups.</p>

  <p><em>Example:</em>To add the example lineage from before explicitely, the
  <em>Group name</em> could be set to <span class="inline-code">BLDc</span> and
  the list of subgroups could be <span class="inline-code">l|BLDc_l,
  r|BLDc_r</span> or even <span class="inline-code">l|BLDc_l-census,
  r|BLDc_r-census</span>.</p>


  <h4>Mapping neurons to subgroups</h4>

  <p>With all groups and subgroups set up, the next step is to find the neurons
  belonging into each subgroup. This is performed in the <em>second tab</em>,
  <em>Matching pairs</em>. These are of course the neurons annotated with the
  respective subgroup annotation, but in addition the Pair Statistics Widget
  will only allow neurons into subgroups that are considered
  <em>complete</em>. This is done to weed out fragments, partial neurons and
  also unreviewed neurons that to increase the quality of the result by making
  individual morphologies more comparable.</p>

  <h4>Completeness</h4>

  <p>Neurons are considered compelete if at least two, optionally three
  conditions are met:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The skeleton doesn't have more than a defined percentage of open
      ends, i.e. leaf nodes plus root that are <em>not marked</em> with one of
      the following tags: "uncertain continuation", "not a branch", "ends",
      "really ends", "uncertain end", "anterior end", "posterior end", "soma",
      "out to nerve". By default 3% open ends are allowed.</li>
    <li>The skeleton has a minimum length, either in terms of nodes (<em>Min
        nodes</em> field) or nanometers (<em>Min cable</em> field).</li>
    <li>Optionally, only neurons that aren't "fragments" can be considered
      complete. A neuron is considered a fragment if it doesn't have either a
      "soma" tagged node or a node tagged "out to nerve". The "Ignore fragments
      checkbox" controls whether this should be tested.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These completeness parameters can be defined separately for both the pattern
  based annotation set and the set of extra groups.
  </p>

  <p>Pressing "Match pairs" will get the completeness information from
  the server. All complete neurons are mapped to their respective subgroups,
  which can be looked at either through the "Active groups" section in the
  content view of the "Matching pairs" tab, or in terms of skeleton sources,
  that are provided for each subgroup. Note that for larger sets of skeletons
  this process can take a few minutes to complete. At the</p>

  <p>The <em>Batch size</em> allows to tune how many skeletons will be queried
  completeness for at a time. If the server supports longer open connections,
  this value can be higher and more data queried in one request.</p>

  <h4>Active groups</h4>

  <p>Shows the list of all found subgroups across all groups. It shows the
  groups each subgroup is found in as well as all <em>complete</em> skeletons
  associated with the respective annotations.</p>

  <p>Additionally, it is possible to define a <em>landmark group</em> for each
  subgroup. These are spatial spaces defined through landmarks (see Landmark
  Widget). This is needed to compute the similarity between pairs across
  subgroups for each group. It allows transforming skeletons from one subgroup
  into the other.</p>

  <h4>Matching pairs</h4>

  <p>Based on the sets of (completed) skeletons that are collected for each
  annotation subgroup, pairs of skeletons are selected that share a common
  annotation. This can be any annotation as long as the annotation is annotated
  with a particular <em>meta-annotation</em>. This meta-annotation is defined in
  terms of the <em>Pairing meta-annotation</em> field in the UI.</p>

  <p>Besides this set of matching skeleton pairs, two other sets of pairs are
  created, resulting in the following three sets of skeleton pairs:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Matching pairs: both skeletons are from different subgroups within the
      same group.</li>
    <li>Same-group pairs: both skeletons are from the same subgroup, regardless
      of their meta-annotations.</li>
    <li>Unmatched pairs: both skeletons are from different subgroups with the
      same group, while one of them has the required meta-annotation and the
      other doesn't.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>These sets will also be available as skeleton sources, in which one color
  is used per skeleton pair.</p>

  <p><em>Example:</em>Consider the previously used example group, the lineage
    <span class="inline-code">BLDc</span>, with its two subgroups
    <span class="inline-code">BLDc_l</span> and <span class="inline-code">BLDc_r</span>.
    In some cases pairs of neurons across both groups have been matched up and
    annotated with <span class="inline-code">hemilateral_pair_<id1>_<id2></span>. These
    annotations in turn are annotated with <span class="inline-code">brain-census</span>.
    Using the <span class="inline-code">brain-census</span> annotation as
    <em>pairing meta-annotation</em> allows the widget to use the fact that some
    pairs are already verified. The <em>Matching pairs</em> tab will then
    display the three sets of skeleton pairs above across these two subgroups,
    viewing all skeleton pairs with both skeleton IDs meta-annotated with
    <span class="inline-code">brain-census</span>.
