<p>
This widget allows users to create persistent deep links into the dataset using
an alias. This alias needs to be unique per project. The link table in the first
tab will only list links that are marked as visible to others who have access to
the project. Links marked as private, are only visible and accessible by the
creator of the link.
</p>

<p>
The stored parameters are the same as for regular deep links, with
most of them being optional, including the widget layout, widget settings and
loaded skeletons. The widget tab to add links allows to configure these options
in the tab button panel. By default the Link Widget itself is ignored when
storing layouts, which can of course be changed as well.

<p>
The alias defined for a link can be used to open the deep link, either by using
the link presented in the widget (the Alias column):
</p>

<p class="inline-code">
&lt;catmaid-url&gt;/&lt;project-id&gt;/links/&lt;alias&gt;
</p>

<p>
which is only an internal redirect to
</p>

<p class="inline-code">
&lt;catmaid-url&gt;?pid=&lt;project-id&gt;&link=&lt;alias&gt;
</p>

<p>
but looks friendlier. Moreover links can be marked private, making them
only accessible (and listable) by the creator of the link.
</p>

<p>
An optional message can be stored with the link and is shown to the user when
the links is opened.
