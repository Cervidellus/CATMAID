<p>
  The central table displays all known publications. These are representated as
  annotatiosn that are themselves annotaed with one of the defined <em>publication
  annotations</em>, they can be configured in the Settings Widget and amount by
  default to to <em>Published, papers, paper</em>. The widget allows to create
  new publications and configure the export options for each publication. The
  export options can either be defined explicitly for each publication (asterisk
  is gray) or the project-wide defaults can be used (asterisk is orange).
  Clicking the check-mark icon will always go into per-publication mode and
  explicitly set the export option. Clicking the asterisk enables inherit-mode
  again.
